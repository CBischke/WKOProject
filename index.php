				<h2>Periapsis Space Company</h2>
				<p>
					Yes. We are a make believe space company living in a real virtual made up universe. You may ask, what universe? And to that question is an easy answer: <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/" target="New Window">The Kerbal Space Program Universe!</a> 
					<br>
					Here at Periapsis Space Program we design, build, test, crash and barely fly interstellar rockets! Most of our scientists have gone to school and have degrees in the 3rd burn, so we might not know calculus, but we certainly know how to guess and check.

				<h3>Dedicated to space. Dedicated to you.</h3>

					Do you need a package delivered to the moon? If yes, just call us! Is this delivery time sensitive? If yes, probably call someone else!

					Our mom's have said that,

					<span class="imp">"We have been the world's leader in interstellar rocketry for the past twenty years." </span>

					Wow! Thats a long time. Imagine where we will be in the next twenty years -- maybe the company headquarters will finally invest in a coffee machine.

			<p>We are not a real company. I don't even get paid. I am a webdeveloper that was forced against my will to develop this website. I am currently in the basement of the CEOs mother's house. Please help. It smells like burnt tomato soup. If you are still reading this, I commend you. No, I applaud  you. Why are you still reading this? Obviously I am not going anywhere with this though. Placing a random &copy; sign makes this footer look official. Yeah. That looks good. &copy;
			<span id="secret">Oh good. You found this line. Please stop reading the footer. I am running out of things to talk about.</span>
