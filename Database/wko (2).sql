The children are at the heart of these challenges and are\r\nthe ones to suffer most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In southeastern Missouri, there is a\r\nhidden pocket of poverty where thousands of families are trying to manage the\r\nchallenges of isolation and poverty on their own. Whole Kids Outreach is there\r\nto help. We are there to help, because in our area â€¦</p>\r\n\r\n<p>â€¦ one-third of the children live\r\nbelow the poverty line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>â€¦ births to teen mothers is 50%\r\nhigher than the state of Missouri overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>â€¦ the areaâ€™s infant mortality rate\r\nis a staggering 11.2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>â€¦ the children need us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With warmth and compassion, Whole\r\nKids Outreach has been helping hundreds of families every year since 1999.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whole Kids Outreach is a faith-based\r\nnonprofit working to address the unmet health and wellness needs of hundreds of\r\nchildren living in rural poverty in Missouri.

These families are\r\noften isolated and lack transportation; therefore, services are brought into\r\nthe familiesâ€™ homes. More than 200-300 pregnant women and families with young\r\nchildren receive these in-home services at any given time. WKO offers additional\r\nprograms and activities at the Whole Kids Outreach Center in Ellington, where\r\nfamilies and children participate in a wide variety of recreational and\r\neducational activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhole Kids Outreach provides services through four programs that are distinct\r\nin their designs and goals, but work an integrated fashion to help meet\r\nfamiliesâ€™ health and wellness needs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClick on any of the programs below for more information:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wholekidsoutreach.org/index.php?page=resource-mothers-program">Resource Mothers Program </a></li>\r\n <li><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wholekidsoutreach.org/index.php?page=maternal-child-visiting-nurse-program">Maternal-Child Visiting Nurse Program</a> </li>\r\n <li><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wholekidsoutreach.org/index.php?page=family-enhancement-program">Family Enhancement Program</a> </li>\r\n <li><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wholekidsoutreach.org/index.php?page=center-based-programs">Center-Based Programs </a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;Resource\r\nMothers Program</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Resource Mothers Program is a service to help prepare expectant parents\r\nfor childbirth. Experienced women from the community serve as WKO Outreach\r\nSpecialists and visit expectant parents in their homes. These committed women,\r\nwho are trained as childbirth educators, help ensure that women receive\r\nadequate prenatal care and how to care for their newborn.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Maternal-Child Visiting Nurse Program</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <em>Maternal-Child Visiting Nurse Program</em>, WKO works in\r\ncollaboration with Nurses for Newborns Foundation (out of St. Louis) to provide\r\nRegistered Nurses to visit expectant and new parents. The nurses help ensure\r\nthat pregnant women receive appropriate prenatal care and health education by\r\nworking with the Outreach Specialists and other community resources. The WKO\r\nRegistered Nurses are experienced Labor and Delivery/Pediatric nurses who, not\r\nonly teach well baby care, but identify potential medical and developmental\r\nissues so that those needs can be addressed as early as possible, giving\r\ninfants the best start in life possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Family Enhancement Program</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Family Enhancement Program focuses on health and child developmental\r\nneeds of families with young children. Many of the families who participate in\r\nthis program have experienced domestic violence, abuse/neglect, or have\r\nchildren who have developmental delays. All of the families who participate in\r\nour prenatal Resource Mothers Program (RMP) transfer to the Family Enhancement\r\nProgram for continued services that are more expansive than the childbirth and\r\nwell-baby education offered in the RMP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the Family Enhancement Program, parents learn skills to raise\r\nhealthy children and families receive help to successfully navigate their daily\r\nlives. The children obtain tools to help ready them for school. They learn such\r\nskills as using words (rather than acting out) to communicate their needs, and\r\nhow to cooperate and play safely. Outreach Specialists also work with families\r\nduring crises episodes to help teach problem-solving skills, which reduce the\r\nnegative impact on the family that such disruptions can cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the comprehensive approach to creating whole kids, the Outreach\r\nSpecialists also address many of the social factors that improve familiesâ€™\r\nheath. During the home visits, we assist parents to continue or further their\r\neducation; learn the skills necessary to improve the skills needed to seek and\r\nsustain gainful employment; obtain adequate housing and childcare; and budget\r\ntheir resources wisely. The Outreach Specialists create individualized Family\r\nService Plans with the parent(s) or guardians to direct and track the familyâ€™s\r\nprogress. Home visits, as part of the Family Enhancement Program, vary in\r\nnumber and frequency and can continue for as long as the family needs our\r\nservices and shows progress toward their goals.</p>'),

The Riding Program can accommodate all\r\nriding disciplines and experience levels for children four-years-old through\r\nadults. Participants learn to care for the horses and equipment as well as to\r\nimprove their horsemanship skills. It also gives parents an opportunity to see\r\ntheir children in a positive light. The shared sense of accomplishment and\r\nincreased self-worth is elemental to the enhancement of positive interactions\r\nbetween parents and their children. The unique instruction provides a\r\ntherapeutic outlet for troubled and/or at-risk youth; and increases a\r\nparticipating childâ€™s readiness to learn in a school environment through an\r\ninnovative enhancement of learning abilities (i.e. respect, patience, following\r\ndirections, etc.).</span></p><h2><span>\r\n<b>Physical Benefits</b></span></h2><p>\r\nWorking with horses, both on the ground and aboard, helps to increase\r\ncoordination and strengthen muscles. Ridersâ€™ muscles are used and strengthened\r\nfrom the time the participants walk out to catch their mounts, throughout the\r\ngrooming tasks, and while working to attain the balance necessary to ride\r\ncorrectly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Riding Program Activities</b></h2><span>\r\nRiding sessions for individual clients in the outreach programsâ€”Any Outreach\r\nSpecialist or RN can refer clients to work with the Riding Program Director to\r\nhelp address specific needs such as increasing attention levels, decreasing\r\nsedentary life style, working through emotional wounds, etc.<br><br>\r\n</span><h2><b>Camp Whole Kids</b></h2><span>All campers receive daily riding instruction as well as\r\nlessons on how to handle themselves around large horses.

All level riders and all\r\ndisciplines are welcome.

Each\r\nvolunteer participates in a thorough orientation that acclimates him/her to the\r\nexpectations of the assigned tasks and connects their service project with the\r\noverall mission of WKO, along with Godâ€™s global mission for our world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The volunteer experiences are\r\nclosely monitored by the Volunteer Coordinator to ensure that the needs of the\r\nvolunteers are met, questions are answered, and that at all times the best\r\ninterests and most immediate needs of the target population are being met by\r\nthe volunteer activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volunteers who participate in\r\nextended projects (more than one day) have the chance to be involved in a\r\nvariety of dynamic projects: service activities with the WKO grounds and\r\nmaintenance team, recreational activities with children of all ages, community\r\noutreach activities for WKO clientele who need help with home improvements to\r\nimprove the safety of their living environments. This diversity of opportunity\r\ndeepens their experience of our mission as well as enhances cultural\r\nsensitivity to those in a rural environment. The Volunteer Coordinator and WKO\r\nstaff closely partner to provide ongoing support to ensure the volunteers\r\ndevelop their understanding of mission; are comfortable with the activities to\r\nwhich they are assigned; and are sensitive to the experience they may be\r\nsharing with other volunteers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volunteering at WKO demands an\r\nextraordinary amount of patience and flexibility. Volunteers are often\r\nchallenged in ways (physical, mental, emotional) that they do not anticipate.\r\nTo this end, the Volunteer Coordinator intentionally arranges a closing\r\nceremony to ritualize the integration of the experience into the volunteersâ€™\r\nlives. This has been essential in assuring that volunteers have the opportunity\r\nto process their emotions and reactions to their experience, that the impact of\r\nthe program is captured in an post-survey, and, most importantly, that\r\nvolunteers receive due recognition and understand our appreciation for their\r\ncontribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For information on how you can volunteer\r\nor set up a volunteer experience for you service group, contact WKOâ€™s Volunteer\r\nCoordinator</p>'),
